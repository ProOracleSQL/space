Second edition:
===============

1. Added note about V$RESERVED_WORDS count in "Chapter 01.sql" possibly being different depending on version and edition. (Found by Do Nhu Vy.)



First edition:
==============

Technical errors:
-----------------
1. The description for the partitioned outer join example in Chapter 7 should be "We want to see the results for launch vehicles with at least one relevant launch in 2017, broken down into months." instead of "We want to see the results for 2017, broken down into months."  Found by Keerthi Teja Tailam.

Grammatical errors:
-------------------
1. Change "But SQL has the huge advantage of not needed..." to "needing".
2. PDF is missing the words "Version control" in front of "isn’t just a place to store an “official copy”" in Chapter 2.

Nice-to-have features for a second edition:
-------------------------------------------
1. In early chapters, always add at least one blank between code lines.
2. For the example in Chapter 6, specify that the example is best read in an IDE, not in the book.
3. Change Hashing diagrams in Chapter 16 - use 4 diagrams instead of 3.
4. Try Kaley's example code for hashing - maybe it does work in some cases?
5. "TEST_FUNCTION" in Chapter 21 - add a blank line or the NULL.
6. Change the MODEL example to avoid multiple spaces.
7. Improve index?
8. In sequence caching, add discussion about large batch sizes and scalable sequences reducing contention on pk index because numbers are so different.
9. Table of contents is too large.  Is it possible to have a shorter table of contents first?  (Suggested by Nadir Doctor.)
10. "Note that we should almost never use Oracle Express Edition".  Add sentance like "Things improved with 18c, but historically the product does not have a good track record."
11. Version control - add note about tools like Liquibase or Flyway.  I'm not a fan, but I'm in  the minority.
