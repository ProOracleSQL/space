Pro Oracle SQL Development Source Code
======================================

These files contain the source code for the book Pro Oracle SQL Development (https://www.apress.com/9781484245163). The examples work for both the first and second edition, except where noted.

Each file contains all the source code used in a chapter.  The files are worksheets and should be run interactively in a graphical IDE such as PL/SQL Developer, Toad, or Oracle SQL Developer.  There are a few installation steps that use SQL\*Plus, but you should not try to develop advanced SQL in SQL\*Plus.

If you have any questions or problems, please contact Jon Heller at jon@jonheller.org.
